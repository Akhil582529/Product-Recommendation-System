# Product-Recommendation-System
This project implements a hybrid product recommendation system that combines multiple recommendation techniques to provide personalized and accurate product suggestions. The system leverages collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches to enhance recommendation quality.

**Features**
Collaborative Filtering: Uses user-item interactions to recommend products.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends products based on their features and user preferences.
Hybrid Approach: Integrates multiple techniques to improve recommendation accuracy.
Interactive User Interface: Allows users to input preferences and receive tailored recommendations.
Data Processing & Analysis: Cleans, preprocesses, and analyzes product and user data for better insights.

**Tech Stack**
Python (for data processing and model implementation)
Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
Scikit-Learn, Surprise (for building recommendation models)
Flask/Django (for backend API) (if applicable)
React/HTML-CSS-JavaScript (for frontend UI) (if applicable)
SQL/NoSQL (for storing product and user data)

**Dataset**
The system uses a dataset containing product information and user interactions, including:
product_name, category, discounted_price, rating, user_id, review_content, etc.

**How It Works**

**Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Cleans and structures the dataset.
**Model Training:** Implements collaborative and content-based filtering techniques.
**Hybrid Recommendations:** Combines approaches to enhance accuracy.
**User Interaction:** Provides a web interface for users to explore personalized recommendations.
